#Sometimes you need to write a lot of things that depend on the results of previous tables. In order to make this easier, there are two keywords that store things without producing any output: "save … as …" does a table lookup and stores it, where as "store … as …" just stores whatever text you give it. Neither produces output. In the example below, "evil power" is the result of a table lookup, where as "Thor" is just that, a text that is being stored. Both "gate" and "statue" can now refer to "same power".

#;temple
#3,[save evil power as power] This is a ruined temple. [gate] [statue]

;history
1,<strong>History:</strong>*Dr Ruby* escaped from Inguria Island in 2044 after a cataclysmic confrontation with the *Freedom League* blew up a volcano.  Luckily, his sister, *Dr Ruby*, had prepared a one-way time travel escape hatch for if things went terribly wrong.  A volcanic island off the coast of early 19th century New South Wales: *Ruby Base*. Unknown to even the Rubys, their second amateurish use of a time machine has had devastating consequences.  Luckily for them, the blowback from the time and space fracture obliterated *Van Diemen's Land*.  Soon, *Sydney Town* will be wondering why they have not heard from them.

;secret history
1,<strong>Secret History:</strong>Elder Races have warred over the Australian continent in the past.  The influence of the Australians has held this at bay. Dr Ruby's part *Fomaulhautian* part *Ingurian* jury-rigged time travel shenanigans may have altered this balance.  The arrival of convicts and settlers brings with it foreign disasters.  The Rubys are also not the only source of Super Science.
